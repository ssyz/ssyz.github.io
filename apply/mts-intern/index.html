        <h2>About the Role</h2>
        <p>We are seeking <strong>first- and second-year university students</strong> who are excited about AI and want hands-on experience contributing to a real startup. This is a <strong>part-time, apprenticeship-style internship</strong> designed for curious builders who want early exposure to product development, applied AI, research, and startup operations. You will work directly with the founder and contribute to meaningful projects from day one. Compensation is modest and contribution-based; the real value comes from ownership, rapid learning, and the opportunity to grow into Associate MTS or early full-time roles with OurDojo over time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h2>About OurDojo</h2>
        <p>OurDojo is a fast-moving, pre-seed, AI-native startup based in New York City. We build tools that help people understand, measure, and improve AI systems. Our work spans three areas:</p>
        <ul class="biz-list">
          <li><strong>Smalltalk</strong> &mdash; our flagship consumer app focused on learning through conversation</li>
          <li><strong>Research</strong> &mdash; independent AI evaluation and education research</li>
          <li><strong>OurDojo for Business</strong> &mdash; applied AI and technology services for small and mid-sized organizations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We believe AI should amplify human curiosity, learning, and capability; not replace it. Our team operates with high ownership, fast iteration, and a builder mindset.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h2>What You'll Get</h2>
        <ul class="biz-list">

          <li>Direct mentorship from the founder (ex-Google, venture-backed startups) and senior advisors</li>
          <li>Exposure to AI product development, research, and startup strategy</li>
          <li>Opportunity for expanded responsibility as the company grows</li>
        </ul>

      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <h2>Compensation</h2>
